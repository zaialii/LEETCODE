# DESCRIPTION

    """
    
    Given a positive integer num, return true if num is a perfect square or false otherwise.

A perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer. In other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.

You must not use any built-in library function, such as sqrt.

 

Example 1:

Input: num = 16
Output: true
Explanation: We return true because 4 * 4 = 16 and 4 is an integer.
Example 2:

Input: num = 14
Output: false
Explanation: We return false because 3.742 * 3.742 = 14 and 3.742 is not an integer.

# SOLUTION

class Solution:
    def isPerfectSquare(self, num: int) -> bool:
        l = 1
        r = num

        while l <= r:
            m = (l+r) // 2
            m_squa = m * m

            if num == m_squa:
                return True
            elif m_squa < num:
                l = m + 1
            else:
                r = m -1 
        
        return False
