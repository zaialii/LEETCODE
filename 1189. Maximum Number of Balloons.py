You can use each character in text at most once. Return the maximum number of instances that can be formed.

 

Example 1:



Input: text = "nlaebolko"
Output: 1

# SOLUTION

class Solution:
    def maxNumberOfBalloons(self, text: str) -> int:
        counter = defaultdict(int)
        balloon = 'balloon'

        for c in text:
            if c in balloon:
                counter[c] +=1

        if any(c not in counter for c in balloon):
            return 0
        else:
            return min(counter['b'], counter['a'], counter['l']//2, counter['o']//2,counter['n'])

        # time : O(n)
        # space : O(1)
